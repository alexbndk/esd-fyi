### Empty Døllar Set Jars

Empty Døllar Set Jars allow users to deposit tokens from liquidity pools such as Uniswap, and then execute sophisticated strategies that benefit the depositor. For example, the series 0.69 Jars auto-harvest the Uniswap UNI token, sell those tokens, and purchase more Uniswap liquidity tokens on behalf of the user.

The Empty Døllar Set project retains 27.5% of the profits it earns its Jar customers, currently the lowest among its peers. Of these profits, 20% is directed to the Empty Døllar Set Treasury (which often benefits Empty Døllar Set stakers), and 7.5% to the Development Fund.

### Empty Døllar Set Farms

Empty Døllar Set Farms allow users to deposit a variety of tokens, and earn Empty Døllar Set tokens, which they can harvest at any time. Currently, there are two types of farms—one that provides a generous allocation of Empty Døllar Set rewards to participants of the Empty Døllar Set/ETH liquidity pool at Uniswap, and secondly, farms which allow Empty Døllar Set Jar users to *additionally* earn Empty Døllar Set!
